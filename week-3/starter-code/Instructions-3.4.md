Instructions

Recreate the Logging Example:

X Create a new subdirectory in week threes home directory and name it morgan-logging
X Create a barebones package.json file with your information (see the barebone’s package.json file example) and add it to the morgan-logging directory
From the morgan-logging directory install Express, EJS, and Morgan (npm install express morgan ejs --save)
Create a new JavaScript file and name it <yourLastName>-<assignmentName>.js
Add the examples code (don’t just use copy/paste, actually go through the process of typing everything out.  Remember, repetition is the key to retention).
Modify the message by supplying your own custom message
Create a new subdirectory in the morgan-logging directory and name it views
Add a new file to the views directory and name it index.ejs
Create a simple layout and output the results – hint: use Bootstrap to format the page and make it look pretty, but nothing complex (see the code snippets)
Run and test the server using a web browser and the provided test cases
