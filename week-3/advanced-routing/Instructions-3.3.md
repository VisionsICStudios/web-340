Instructions

Recreate the Routing Example:

X Create a new subdirectory in week three's home directory and name it advanced-routing
X Create a barebones package.json file with your information (see the barebone’s package.json file example) and add it to the advanced-routing directory
X From the advanced-routing directory install Express, EJS, and Morgan (npm install express morgan ejs --save)
X Create a new JavaScript file and name it <yourLastName>-<assignmentName>.js
Add the examples code (don’t just use copy/paste, actually go through the process of typing everything out.  Remember, repetition is the key to retention).
Modify the parameter value to employeeId and the output to match (cascade change the productId to employeeId)
Create a new subdirectory in the advanced-routing directory and name it views
Add a new file to the views directory and name it index.ejs
Create a simple layout and output the results – hint: use Bootstrap to format the page and make it look pretty, but nothing complex (unless you are bored)
Run and test the server using a web browser and the provided test cases
