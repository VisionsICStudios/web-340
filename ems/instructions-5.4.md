Instructions

Create a new subdirectory in web-340’s home directory (yes, this should be outside of your week five’s directory) and name it ems
Create a barebone package.json file with your information (see the barebone’s package.json file example) and add it to the ems directory
From the ems directory install Express, EJS, Morgan, and Body-Parser (npm install express ejs morgan body-parser --save)
Create a new JavaScript file and name it app.js
Add the EJS Layout Example’s code (don’t just copy/paste actually go through the process of typing everything out. Remember, repetition is the key to retention)
Create a subdirectory in the ems directory and name it views
Add the following EJS pages:
header.ejs
navbar.ejs
footer.ejs
scripts.ejs
index.ejs
list.ejs
new.ejs
view.ejs
Using your own flavor “enhance” the styling of the Layout Example’s code base.
Create your own index.ejs landing page.  You must create your own version of a landing page.  Keep it professional and appropriate, but have fun and showcase your style.
