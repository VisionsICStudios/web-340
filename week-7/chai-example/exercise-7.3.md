Instructions

Recreate the Chai Example

Create a new subdirectory in week seven's home directory and name it chai-example
Create a barebone package.json file with your information (see the barebone’s package.json file example) and add it to the chai-example directory
From the chai-example directory install Chai and Mocha (npm install mocha chai --save)
Add a new JavaScript file and name it <yourLastName>-fruits.js
Create a fruits() function that splits a comma separated string into an array (follow the Chai example code and make sure you export the module)
Create a new directory and name it test
Add a new JavaScript file to the test directory and name it <yourLastName>-<assignmentName>.js
Add the examples code (don’t just copy/paste, actually go through the process of typing everything out.  Remember, repetition is the key to retention)
Run and test the server using the npm manager (type npm test)
